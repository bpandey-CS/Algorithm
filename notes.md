Priority Queue (PQ) Abstract Data Type (ADT) is similar to normal Queue ADT, but with these two major operations:

1. Enqueue(x): Put a new element (key) x into the PQ (in some order),
2. y = Dequeue(): Return an existing element y that has the highest priority (key) in the PQ and if ties, return the one that is inserted first, i.e. back to First-In First-Out (FIFO) behavior of a normal Queue
